(ns tedai.methods.datom
  "tedai (手代) kotoba Datom audit projector — every DesktopOp is a Datom (G7/G9).

  1:1 Clojure port of `20-actors/tedai/methods/datom.py`.

  Projects a planned (or, post-activation, executed) DesktopOp into kotoba EAVT
  entity maps and assembles a `kg.ingest_batch` body. This is the G7 audit trail:
  as-of, replayable. Three safety rules:

    - G3 no-secret-leak: only flag KEYS are serialized into `:op/args` (never
      values, which could carry a path fragment or token).
    - G9 evidence-minimization: evidence enters the log as a sha256 HASH, never a
      raw frame; the projector refuses a raw-frame payload by construction.
    - G6 dry-run: `:op/dry-run` is True at R0; live ingest into kotoba is
      operator-gated (refused here).

  `planned-at` is supplied by the caller — this module performs no clock reads, so
  its output is deterministic. Self-contained sha-256 (host I/O behind #?(:clj));
  ':ns/name' kept AS strings; string-keyed maps."
