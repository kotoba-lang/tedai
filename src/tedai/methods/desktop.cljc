(ns tedai.methods.desktop
  "tedai (手代) DesktopOp parser/planner — member-computer operation, stdlib only (ADR-2606101400).

  1:1 Clojure port of `20-actors/tedai/methods/desktop.py`.

  The uniform vocabulary is a normalized DesktopOp (the karakuri ServiceOp
  pattern lifted to the OS layer): `app` · `noun` · `verb` · classified `safety`
  (read/create/update/delete/outward) + a `destructive` flag + the selected
  adapter `tier`. A CLI string

      tedai <app> <noun>.<verb> [--flag value ...]

  parses into exactly one DesktopOp. This module does the offline-safe parts
  purely and deterministically: command parsing, app resolution against a
  :representative registry, safety classification (incl. the OS-layer-specific
  `:outward` class — a verb whose effect leaves the device: send/pay/post/upload),
  adapter-tier selection (T1 scripting/accessibility-API first), the stance gate
  (the T2 vision-pointer adapter is refused on a synthetic-input-prohibited app
  — G2; anti-cheat games and DRM players are the canonical case), the karakuri
  route (browser apps are karakuri's surface — N7), and the mutate/outward gates
  (G5). It emits a dry-run plan and never injects input or touches the network
  (G6). The T2 vision action plan is built by `t2_vision.py`.

  G1 own-device · G2 T1-preferred / stance-honest · G5 read-default/mutate-gated
  + outward-gated · G6 actuation-gated · G8 :representative registry (unknown app
  degrades honestly) · N7 browser → karakuri.

  Pure Clojure (clojure.core + clojure.string only), portable .cljc."

;; Axes:
;;   "t1"     — the app's official automation surface (AppleScript/JXA +

;;              own CLI). True → T1 is selected.
;;   "t2"     — the SYNTHETIC-INPUT stance: "permitted" / "restricted" /
;;              "prohibited"; a "prohibited" stance refuses the T2
;;              vision-pointer adapter by construction (G2), EVEN where T2
;;              would technically work. Missing → "prohibited" (default-deny
;;              input injection — safest). ("restricted" treated as
;;              "permitted" at R0 — reserved for a future per-app scope limit.)
;;   "route"  — surface owned by a sibling actor; "karakuri" routes browser
;;              apps to karakuri by construction (N7 — one owner per surface).
;; Anti-cheat games + DRM players are the canonical :prohibited case (the
;; desktop analogue of karakuri's Google/Facebook api-ok/browser-prohibited
;; case).
