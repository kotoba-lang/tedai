(ns tedai.methods.actuate-live
  "tedai (手代) live-actuation membrane — the SINGLE place live input injection could occur (G6/G3).

  1:1 Clojure port of `20-actors/tedai/methods/actuate_live.py`.

  Every path that would actually touch the member's device (click, keystroke, file
  mutation) funnels through `authorize-actuation`. It refuses unless ALL FOUR
  authorities are present:

    1. env flag `TEDAI_ALLOW_LIVE_ACTUATION=1`   (operator's process-level intent)
    2. `operator-token`                           (operator gate; G6)
    3. `council-attestation`                      (Council Lv6+ attestation ref; G6)
    4. `member-sig`                               (member signature over the exact DesktopOp;
                                                   G3/G5 — a server signature is refused)

  Even with all four present, R0 throws (NotImplementedError analogue): the
  input-driver layer (OS accessibility permissions, HID APIs) is R1+ work gated on
  a Council activation ADR. This module proves the *refusal chain*, not execution.

  No clock reads; no network. Host env access is behind `#?(:clj ...)`."
