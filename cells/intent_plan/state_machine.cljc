(ns tedai.cells.intent-plan.state-machine
  "Phase state machine for the tedai intent_plan (手代) cell.

  1:1 port of `cells/intent_plan/state_machine.py` (ADR-2606101400). Graph:
  parse-brief -> prohibition-scan -> emit-plan. Turns a member brief (at R0: a
  list of literal `tedai …` command lines; the NL → command leg is the Murakumo
  planner at R1, G4) into gated DesktopOps. The prohibition scan refuses a brief
  that asks for surveillance or detection-evasion in INTENT (G8/G2/N1/N2) BEFORE
  any op is planned — the verb sets in t2_vision are what make those
  unrepresentable at the step level; this scan refuses them at the intent level.

  G2/G8 (prohibition scan) · G5 (each op carries its mutate gate) · G6 (dry-run
  plans only).

  Conventions (mimamori/methods/bond.cljc + shionome regime_observer house
  style):
    - dataclass PlanState → a plain map with kebab keyword keys
    - Python `\":…\"`-equivalent value identities (outcomes, phase values, op
      safety classes) stay bare strings
    - PlanPhase enum value identities (\"init\"/\"parsed\"/… ) stay strings
    - transitions are pure fns; illegal transition / empty-brief → ex-info
    - the `desktop.plan` dependency is ported as a self-contained `plan-op` so
      the cell is runnable on JVM/babashka/SCI without the Python methods layer

  The wrapper state map mirrors the Python dict 1:1: kebab keyword keys
  (`:cell-state`, `:brief`, `:command-lines`, `:next-node`); the Python
  `next_node` string identities (\"prohibition_scan\"/\"emit_plan\"/\"end\") stay
  strings."
