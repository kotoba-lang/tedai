(ns tedai.cells.intent-plan.test-state-machine
  "clojure.test port of the intent_plan assertions from
  `cells/test_state_machines.py` (ADR-2606101400).

  Ports ONLY the three intent_plan cases (test_clean_brief_plans_gated_dry_run_ops
  + the 4-way parametrized test_prohibited_intent_refused_before_planning +
  test_empty_command_lines_raise). The Python file ALSO covers the OTHER four
  tedai cells' state machines — those are DEFERRED (they exercise sibling cells'
  `state_machine.py` / `cell.py` not yet ported to .cljc):
    - app_resolve     (5 cases) — transition_lookup/tier_select/stance
    - pairing_broker  (8 cases) — verify_owner/build_grant/authorize_mutate
                                  (incl. the :outward council-gate case)
    - actuate_invoke  (6 cases) — plan_op/stance_gate/mutate_gate/build_adapter_plan
    - evidence_audit  (3 cases) — hash_evidence/project_datoms/assemble_batch
    - test_solve_raises_at_r0 (parametrized over all 5 cells; R0 .solve() raises)

  Charter-gate invariants exercised here: G6 (dry-run only) + G8/G2 (the
  intent-level prohibition scan refuses bossware/surveillance + detection-evasion
  BEFORE planning — see prohibited-intents)."
