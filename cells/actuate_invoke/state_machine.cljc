  "Phase state machine for the tedai 手代 actuate_invoke cell.
  1:1 port of cells/actuate_invoke/state_machine.py (ADR-2606101400). plan-op → stance-gate →
  mutate-gate → build-adapter-plan → dry-run-emit. Wires desktop + t2_vision into the gated path:
  a T2 op gets a vision plan only when its stance gate is clean (G2); every op stops at dry-run (G6).
  The DesktopOp is the keyword-keyed map returned by desktop/plan."
